# Esoteric first

With .bat files, you can do some esoteric shit. Minor example is here the `start` command with it's problem on double qoutes. ._.

# Command now!

A simple command in the **first** line will do here anything you want, if you don't want that a new CMD window pops up after clicking on it - simply:

`@echo off`

will do it!

Questions here: Comments in first line not possible with it? Why first line? Why not somewhere in the script **before** you typed any command?

# .bat file icons...

seems to be not possible. I needed them for some automated workflow-start that i construct actually, and got 2 test projects for that.

In depth it seems, that an executable on Windows NT can contain ITSELF an icon.
The [MSDN on this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997538.aspx) documents that pretty accurate, for my uses here.

That makes obvious, that you cannot store an icon in a text file, what a .bat file is.
But, whait... that fancy icons on your desktop - if we can have THEM in a .lnk file, we could store an icon an a link too?

Of course. Right click on the linked .bat file, and you can select your own icon!



Short story, but such a question comes up if you didn't work the most of the time with windows machines....
